# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms


To run the code :

    gcc HW3.c 

    ./a.out TaskFile.txt

Each line in the task file describes a single task. Each task has a name, a priority(for algorithms that need priority), arrival time
and a CPU burst separated by commas.

Priority, burst time, and arrival time are represented by an integer number. The higher the number, the higher the priority.

Task file structure : 
      task id , priority , task arrival time , burst time
  
Example task file:    

      1, 4, 0,10
  
      2, 3, 3, 8
  
      3, 3, 2, 9
